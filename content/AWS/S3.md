## Vocab
- **Bucket**: A globally unique container for objects.
- **Object**: A file and its metadata stored in a bucket.
- **Key**: A unique identifier for an object within a bucket (effectively its "path").

---

## General Notes
- **Buckets**: Flat storage (no true sub-buckets). Folder-like behavior is simulated using **prefixes** (e.g., `user1/photos/img1.jpg`).
- **Bucket Names**: Must be **globally unique** because S3 uses a single DNS namespace to resolve bucket URLs (e.g., `https://mybucket.s3.amazonaws.com`), ensuring consistent routing across regions.
- **Regions**: Buckets are region-bound for latency and cost optimization, but names remain globally unique.

### Consistency Model
- **Data Consistency**: Refers to how quickly changes (e.g., writes, updates) become visible.
- **S3 Consistency**:
  - **Strong Consistency**: After a successful write or overwrite, all reads reflect the latest version.
  - Deleting or overwriting an object ensures immediate visibility of the change.

### Access Control
- **Bucket Policies**: JSON documents for bucket-level permissions (e.g., allow public read for specific paths).
- **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**: Provide object-level permissions; use sparingly as bucket policies are more scalable.
- **S3 Access Points**: Simplify managing access for shared datasets with unique hostnames and policies.
- **Presigned URLs**: Use a powerful role to temporarily grant its own access to objects without modifying permissions.

### Design Patterns
### Public and Private Access for a Web App
- **Public Images**:
  - Store in `"public/images/"` and allow public access using a bucket policy:
    ```json
    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Principal": "*",
          "Action": "s3:GetObject",
          "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::mybucket/public/*"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
- **User Images**:
  - Store in `"users/{userID}/images/"` and restrict access using `aws:username` in a bucket policy:
    ```json
    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Principal": {
            "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::accountID:user/{username}"
          },
          "Action": "s3:GetObject",
          "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::mybucket/users/{username}/*"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

### Multi-Tenant Bucket
- Use prefixes (e.g., `"team1/data/"`) for shared datasets.
- Manage access via prefixes in the bucket policy.

### Bucket-Per-Use
- Separate buckets for teams or projects to simplify cost tracking.
- Limited to **10,000 buckets per account**.

### Pricing
```
add actual charges with links to their sites
```
- **Storage Classes**:
  - **Standard**: Default, low-latency storage.
  - **Infrequent Access**: Cheaper for rarely accessed data.
  - **Glacier**: Archival storage with retrieval delays.
- **Request Costs**: Charged per operation (e.g., PUT, GET, LIST).
- **Data Transfer**: Costs apply for outbound transfers.
- **Optimization**: Use lifecycle rules to auto-archive unused objects.
